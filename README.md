## Hyperdrive Documentation

Hyperdrive is a decentralized autonomous organization focused on driving the the adoption of the Layer2 Ethereum ecosystem. With the Ethereum merge complete, nearly all Ethereum thought leaders agree that layer2 protocols are key to the future of the Ethereum ecosystem.But, adoption has been slow, and the speed of L2 adoption needs to be accelerated for L2 NFTs.&#x20;

Hyperdrive is expanding the Ethereum L2 NFT ecosystem. Hyperdrive is governed by HD token holders. Through the proposal and voting process, HD token holders will determine the actions and direction of Hyperdrive.

#### Why Hyperdrive? <a href="#why-layer2" id="why-layer2"></a>

The increasing number of applications and users on Ethereum are responsible for increasing the load on the network. The capacity of the Ethereum network is limited. Therefore, the cost of using the network increases prominently with more and more users competing with each other for adding transactions to the Ethereum network.So, Ethereum [layer2](https://ethereum.org/en/layer-2/) scaling solutions are considered vital instruments for addressing the problems with network performance. Many solutions for Ethereum scaling are undergoing research, testing, and implementation with different approaches for achieving scalability.The primary objectives of scalability for the Ethereum network refer to improvement in transaction speed alongside transaction throughputs. At the same time, the scaling solutions should not compromise the security or decentralization of the Ethereum network. Ethereum also experiences the concerns of unreasonable gas prices and slower transactions on the layer 1 blockchain. As of now, Ethereum has two distinct options in the form of sharding and layer 2 solutions for addressing the problems of scalability, high transaction fees, and delays in transaction settlement.
